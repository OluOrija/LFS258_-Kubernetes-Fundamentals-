```bash
# List local Docker images for nginx to check available versions
# Helpful when choosing a version for the image update
sudo docker image ls nginx
```

```bash
# Retrieve the DaemonSet configuration and display the update strategy section
# This allows you to verify the current update strategy (e.g., RollingUpdate)
kubectl get ds ds-one -o yaml | grep -A 4 Strategy
```

```bash
# Open the DaemonSet configuration for editing
# Modify the update strategy from RollingUpdate to OnDelete to control when Pods are updated
kubectl edit ds ds-one
```

```bash
# Update the container image of the DaemonSet to a newer nginx version using the `set image` command
# This prepares the DaemonSet for an update while using the OnDelete strategy
kubectl set image ds ds-one nginx=nginx:1.26-alpine --record
```

```bash
# Describe the existing Pod to verify the currently running image version
# At this point, the image should remain unchanged due to the OnDelete update strategy
kubectl describe po ds-one-b1dcv | grep Image:
```

```bash
# Delete the existing Pod to trigger creation of a new Pod using the updated image
# This simulates a rollout under the OnDelete update strategy
kubectl delete po ds-one-b1dcv
```

```bash
# List all Pods to confirm that the deleted Pod has been recreated
# The new Pod should have the updated nginx image version
kubectl get pod
```

```bash
# Describe the new Pod that replaced the deleted one to confirm the updated image version
kubectl describe pod ds-one-xc86w | grep Image:
```

```bash
# Describe the older Pod (not deleted yet) to confirm it still uses the older image version
# This shows that updates only happen when individual Pods are deleted
kubectl describe pod ds-one-z31r4 | grep Image:
```

```bash
# View the rollout history of the DaemonSet
# Shows past revisions and the commands used to change them
kubectl rollout history ds ds-one
```

```bash
# View details of the first revision of the DaemonSet
# Useful for comparing configurations between different revisions
kubectl rollout history ds ds-one --revision=1
```

```bash
# View details of the second revision of the DaemonSet
# This should show the updated nginx image version
kubectl rollout history ds ds-one --revision=2
```

```bash
# Roll back the DaemonSet to a previous revision (revision 1)
# Since the OnDelete strategy is still active, existing Pods won’t change until they’re manually deleted
kubectl rollout undo ds ds-one --to-revision=1
```
