```bash
# Copy the existing 'rs.yaml' file to create a new DaemonSet YAML configuration file named 'ds.yaml'
# This provides a base configuration to modify from a ReplicaSet to a DaemonSet
cp rs.yaml ds.yaml
```

```bash
# Open the 'ds.yaml' file in the vim text editor
# This allows you to edit the file and change the resource kind from ReplicaSet to DaemonSet
vim ds.yaml
```

```bash
# Apply the DaemonSet configuration defined in 'ds.yaml' to the Kubernetes cluster
# This creates a DaemonSet that will ensure a Pod is running on every node
kubectl create -f ds.yaml
```

```bash
# Get the status of all DaemonSets in the current namespace
# This shows how many Pods are desired, current, ready, and available, indicating successful rollout
kubectl get ds
```

```bash
# Get a list of all Pods in the cluster
# This is used to confirm that the DaemonSet has launched one Pod per node
kubectl get pod
```

```bash
# Describe a specific Pod created by the DaemonSet
# Used to inspect details like the image version, to ensure the correct container image is being used
kubectl describe pod ds-one-b1dcv | grep Image:
